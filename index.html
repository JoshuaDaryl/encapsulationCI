    <h1>ENCAPSULATION</h1>
    <p class="author"> <em>For CI Presentation</em></p>
    <h2>ENCAPSULATION:</h2>
    <div class="label">
    <p class="center">Bundling of attributes (values) and behaviours (methods) into one unit or package.</p>
    <p class="center">+</p>
    <p class="center"> Information Hiding (Privacy)</p>
    </div>
    <p class="author"><em>â€¦.WHY? the purpose of the BUNDLING is to control and implement PRIVACY measures. Aswell as VALIDATE values.
    </em></p>
    <h2>Think of VARIABLES.....</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Variables stored outside of a class, GLOBAL, anything can access and control it</li> 
        <li>Variables inside of a class, LOCAL, the class parameters define access and control of the
            values.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Variables and functions in classes have access modifiers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>PRIVATE = Allows access to the class/object state through the classes own functions</li>
        <li>PROTECTED = Allows access from classes in the same package or a child class through inheritance.</li>
        <li>PUBLIC = NO restrictions, access and modification wherever and whenever required.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="label">
        <p>WE SET THESE WITH ACCESS MODIFIERS(Python)</p>
        <p class="center">Josh = Josh      <<<<<(Public)</p>
        <p class="center">_Josh = Josh      <<<<<(Protected)</p>
        <p class="center">__Josh = Josh.     <<<<<(Private)</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Think of a nightclub bouncer, anyone can not just walk-in, we need to provide ID so our age can be
        VALIDATED before we gain ACCESS to the nightclub. In this scenario the bouncer is the METHOD. The partygoer is the USER. The nightclub is the VARIABLE</p>
        <p>Get and Set</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bouncer will read(GET) nightclubRules when we ask him for entrance </li>
            <li>The bouncer will use our age and write(SET) our age to VALIDATE whether we can enter</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Basically the public cannot walk in and gain access without going through the bouncer, this obviously helps validate that nobody underage enters and restricts who can and cannot have access </p>
    <h2>THE COFFEE MACHINE</h2>
    <p>If we were able to set directly to the coffee machine our coffee strength we may run into issues</p>
    <p class="center"><em>If a coffee machine had 3 strengths, what would happen if we input a strength of 4?</em></p>
    <p>Likely the coffee machine would either not work at all or not work as intended! Other functions within the object/class would likely not be able to function without a valid input</p>
    <p>Think of the class functions as INTERMEDIARIES that can GET (read) and SET (write), they will do this providing the parameters in the function are met, SEE EXAMPLE </p>
    
    <p>Therefore when we go through a (set)method the object can validate whether the input is valid before writing to the coffee machine, see below</p>
    <img src="example1.png" alt="Example" class="centre"/>
    <p>This will eliminate errors occurring that would have happened if we were able to set the objects variables ourselves</p>
